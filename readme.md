## Build Instructions
Clone all files into a local repository. Run "go run ." in command line to run.  
Do NOT run "go run gws.go" Because the Go files have been split up, this command will not work.    
In your preferred browser, navigate to localhost:8080. Alternatively, navigate to localhost:8080/help for a list of possible API calls.
